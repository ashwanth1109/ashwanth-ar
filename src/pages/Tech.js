        that empowers mid to large scale engineering and manufacturing companies
        reduce their process cycle times. We achieve this by enabling teams to

        allowing people, data and processes to interact painlessly and to
        seamlessly generate insights for business managers. You can read more

        This page is categorized into two sections. <br />
        <br />
        The first section called{" "}
        <a
          href="#content-and-code"
          onClick={() =>
            section1.current

                  behavior: "smooth",
                  block: "center"
                })
              : null
          }
          className="highlight underline"
        >
          Content and Code
        </a>{" "}
        comprises of articles grouped into a particular theme based on topics I
        have been recently exploring. You can click on the theme in order to see
        articles inside each theme. <br />
        <br />
        The second section called{" "}
        <a
          href="#mini-apps"
          onClick={() =>
            section2.current

          }
          className="highlight underline"
        >
          Mini Apps
        </a>{" "}
        is a collection of mini projects I worked on over the course of my
        learning journey back in the initial days. Nothing fancy, but it holds a
        ton of sentimental value to me and is a constant reminder of how many
        hours seemlessly passed by when I worked on them.
