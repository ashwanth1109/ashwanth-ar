## Lecture 1 - Introduction and Scope

<br/>

### Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is about algorithms enabled by constraints exposed by representations that support models targeted at thinking, perception and action.

### The Generate and Test Method

This method consists of generating some possible solutions and feeding them into a box that tests them. Most of these solutions will fail but some will succeed.

<blockquote>
Once you can name something, you’re conscious of it. You have power over it. You’re in control. You own it. - <span>Robin Williams</span></blockquote>

Two Working Parts - (1) Generator (2) Tester

You need to build a generator with certain properties, for example, they need to be (1) Non redundant - shouldn't give you the same solution twice (2) informable - able to absorb information and act on them

### Relating Evolution to Machine Learning

The rise of AI and ML has been driven by advances, not only in the field of computer science but also in the fields of cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology etc. Through the studies of the evolution of the human species, it is becoming increasingly clear why we are the way the we are today and how we got to be that way.

High-school biology explains our evolution to be a slow, gradual and continuous improvement. But it might not be the case. There are some characteristics of our species that are informative when it comes to guiding the activities of each individual. The modern (anatomically speaking) human has been around for almost 200,000 years. In the ensuing 150,000 years, we didn't actually amount to much. But somehow, just 50,000 years ago, a small group of humans developed a capability that would separate them from all other species. A group of us developed the ability to take two concepts and combine them to make a third concept without disturbing the original two concepts without limit. We learnt to be able to describe things in a way that was intimately connected with language and that in the end is what separated us from all other species.

### Solve Later: A Fox, Chicken and Sack of Grain

You have a fox, a chicken and a sack of grain. You must cross a river with only one of them at a time. If you leave the fox with the chicken he will eat it; if you leave the chicken with the grain he will eat it. How can you get all three across safely?
