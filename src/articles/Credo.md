### The unexamined life is a life not worth living - Socrates

The word credo originates from Middle English Latin, in which the word means 'I believe'. The word creed has similar roots and refers to a system of religious beliefs or a faith. 'Credo' refers to a statement of beliefs or aims which guides someone's actions.

While I understand the pivotal role that religion plays in the lives of many, stricken by their faiths and gods, I've never been a particularly religious person. Perhaps there is a higher entity that governs the whims of the universe, but that is beyond the comprehension of us mortal beings. So, I leave it at that and that is the extent of my belief in the supernatural.

But I do have a strong belief system that governs my actions on a daily basis. This system is my truth. It is the way I perceive the world. We each have our own. A system that evolves for each of us over the entire course of our lives. Sometimes faster, sometimes slower. Up until the age of 23, I was constantly gathering wisdom from those around me. I consider myself fortunate to have met the erudite mentors and peers that I have had in life. My beliefs constantly fluctuated but this was a journey that had to pan out in its own time and there would be no rushing it.

## The antithesis of my very being

2018 was an interesting year in my life. Alongside fluctuating beliefs, I had been incredibly indecisive about my career path. I had a degree in Electronics Engineering and a masters in Management Studies. But I wanted to do something else.

A few fundamental computer science classes had revealed a sliver of a programmer in me during my undergraduate. Against what conventional wisdom would seem to suggest, I chose to become a software engineer although my background didn't fully correlate with this decision.

As a personal hobby, I chose to learn the piano (or a keyboard if I was being technically accurate). I took classes as a kid, however if you'd ask anyone who I've gone to school with (and that's over 19 years of education mind you), they'd say they had never even seen me close to a piano, let alone play it and they'd be right.

One could say it might as well have been a flip of the coin that I based these choices off of. That's how random it felt. It was like I decided to render all my previous experiences pointless and start all over again. It felt like the antithesis of my very being. But it wasn't.

I enjoyed programming and had even pursued a minor in computer science in college. With my piano classes as a kid, I had a basic background in music theory. Neither enough to enable my choices, but it was a start. As bizarre as my choices seemed at the time, it was the only thing that I was certain about. Atleast I had a decision made, which was more than what I could say about my past.

It was in January of that year that I decided to forge my beliefs based on my experiences thus far, centered around these choices. I started reading a few books which granularly coalesced my beliefs into principles of concrete substance. Through my readings (and several re-readings) of these books, I had put together my core beliefs. Unlike the ever fleeting beliefs from my past, these ones remain unchanged. It has undergone a few natural tweaks that stemmed from my discussions of these beliefs with others but I'm convinced in my way of life.

This page summarizes the bible I live by and is my record of continuing to fervently stick to its beliefs while keeping an open mind to criticism & change from those around me.

## The 10,000 hour goal and how I sold my soul to the Devil

It has been almost two years (at the time of writing this) since the formulation of my beliefs. A friend of mine who I hadn't met in almost 4 years said that I had changed and that working in a startup had made me soulless. While I do admit that the startup culture and its toxically fervent requirement to HUSTLE ALL THE FREAKIN TIME has played a part in this, I promise you, it goes beyond this.

Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is a book that has played a pivotal role in my philosophy. Not all chapters in a book are made equal. While there are parts of the book I occasionally skim through to entertain my whims and fancies, the 2nd chapter of the book, titled 'The 10,000 hour rule' is etched into my memory (well, atleast the principles of it are). Of the stories that the author illustrates to make his point, the ones I would like to recollect below are that of Bill Joy and that of the Beatles.

<Accordion title="Bill Joy: The Edison of the internet">

Bill Joy was a computer programmer who took on the task of rewriting UNIX which is an operating system and his verion of the OS still runs in millions of computers. He cofounded Sun Microsystems and was a major contributor to Java. Often called the Edison of the internet, he is regarded as one of the most influential people in the history of computing. He is an established pioneer but his journey to getting there provides some interesting insights to chew on.

In the early 1970s, at the time when Joy was looking to apply to college, computers were the size of rooms and programming was a tedious endeavour. Computer programs were written using punch cards with the operator processing one task at a time and the tiniest of errors meant you had to rewrite the program and resubmit the punch cards. More than being a test of logical reasoning, it was a test of your patience as a programmer.

It was exactly at this point of time that computers got powerful enough to handle hundreds of tasks in real time through the advent of a concept called time sharing. The school that Joy went to, Michigan, was one of probably only 3 other schools that had these new computers. Joy found his happy place when he accidentally upon a unique opportunity that only a handful in the world got. To program on a time sharing computer. While student time on these machines was limited to a fixed amount of money every student got, he found a bug in the system that let him extend his time without ever getting charged. He spent more time in the Computer Centre than his classes, staying up all night at the Centre.

At Michigan Joy was programming eight or ten hours a day. Programming in earnest by sophomore year. Add in the summers, and his first year at Berkley (where he was a graduate student). By the time he had started writing proficient code during his 2nd year at Berkley, he had accumulated 10,000 hours of practice.

<Accordion title="The Beatles & the Hamburg crucible">

The Beatles were an English rock band, considered one of the most influential bands of all time. In 1960, they were a struggling high school rock band without a drummer comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Stuart Sutcliffe.

At the time, their booking agent, Allan Williams, a 29 year old Liverpool businessman and promoter met with Bruno Koschmider, the owner of the Indra club down in Hamburg. Bruno had the idea of bringing in bands to play down at his strip club. The format would be a non stop show, hour after hour, as the bands tried to catch the passing traffic to prompt clientele to lurch in and out.

Williams wanted to send Rory Storm and the Hurricanes (of which Ringo Starr was a member before joining the Beatles towards the end of 1962), but they were committed to another offer. So, he decided to send the Beatles down with the intention of finding a better musical group to replace them. Looking for a drummer, they found Pete Best, who was regarded as a steady drummer with the capability to play the bass on all 4 beats. With this new makeshift group, they made the journey to Hamburg.

So what was special about Hamburg that made this ragtag group of misfits into the band that started a music revolution with the onset of Beatlemania? It wasn't that the acoustics were fantastic, it wasn't. Or that the audience was savvy and appreciative, they weren't. It was the sheer amount of time the band was forced to play. As Lennon recollects their experience in Hamburg, "We got better and got more confidence. We couldn't help it with all the experience playing all night long. In Hamburg, we had to play for 8 hours."
As their reputation grew and the clubs started packing crowds, they were playing 7 nights a week.

The Beatles travelled to Hamburg 5 times between 1960 and 1962. On the 1st trip, they played a 106 nights, 5 or more hours a night. On the 2nd, they played 92 nights and on the 3rd, they played 48 nights, gradually increasing the number of hours over this period. Their last 2 Hamburg gigs involved another 90 hours over 2 months. In a year and a half, they had performed for a total of 270 nights in just a year and a half.

By the time they had their first commercial success in 1964, they had performed live 1200 times. They had not only had a significant jump in their stamina, they had also learnt an incredible number of covers and were more disciplined on stage after their Hamburg crucible. It was the making of them.
