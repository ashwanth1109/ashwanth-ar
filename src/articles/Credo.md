The word credo originates from Middle English Latin, in which the word means 'I believe'. The word creed has similar roots and refers to a system of religious beliefs or a faith. 'Credo' refers to a statement of beliefs or aims which guides someone's actions.

While I understand the pivotal role that religion plays in the lives of many, stricken by their faiths and gods, I've never been a particularly religious person. Perhaps there is a higher entity that governs the whims of the universe, but that is beyond the comprehension of us mortal beings. So, I leave it at that and that is the extent of my belief in the supernatural.

But I do have a strong belief system that governs my actions on a daily basis. This system is my truth. It is the way I perceive the world. We each have our own. A system that evolves for each of us over the entire course of our lives. Sometimes faster, sometimes slower. Up until the age of 23, I was constantly gathering wisdom from those around me. I consider myself fortunate to have met the erudite mentors and peers that I have had in life. My beliefs constantly fluctuated but this was a journey that had to pan out in its own time and there would be no rushing it.

2018 was an interesting year in my life. It was in January of that year that I decided to forge my beliefs based on my experiences thus far, leading up to that moment. At the time, I was reading a number of books which granularly coalesced my beliefs into principles of concrete substance. The core of which were -

1. [Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.amazon.in/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0141036257/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1RGCGJ0BJCTAF&keywords=outliers+by+malcolm+gladwell&qid=1560279635&s=books&sprefix=outlier%2Cstripbooks%2C330&sr=1-1)

At the end of 2016, I also got to meet Dan Ariely, the author of [Predictably Irrational: The Hidden forces that Shape our Decisions](https://www.amazon.in/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/0007368542/ref=sr_1_6?adgrpid=60619154524&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI47enuI7i4gIVWaqWCh2xRQHdEAAYAiAAEgJixvD_BwE&hvadid=294110236692&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1007768&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t2&hvqmt=b&hvrand=13484501459992230175&hvtargid=kwd-326433336924&hydadcr=23636_1725033&keywords=thinking+fast+slow&qid=1560279737&s=gateway&sr=8-6). His book along with a course on Coursera called [Learning How to Learn by Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) were resources I referred to again as I began to formulate my system.

3 months later, I had put together my core beliefs which hasn't changed much, barring a few natural tweaks that stemmed from learnings since. This page summarizes the bible I live by and is my record of continuing to fervently stick to its beliefs while keeping an open mind to criticism & change from those around me.
