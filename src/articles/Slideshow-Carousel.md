# Automatic Slideshow Carousel in React

In the past few months of working in React, I have simply fallen in love with the framework. Call me biased, but I’m a huge fan of having to think in terms of components, state, and props. A while back, I worked on an automatic slideshow component and I had a lot of fun trying to come up with the logic for it.

You can find the entire code for this in my Github repo here: https://github.com/ashwanth1109/ReactSlideshow
