        I'm a full stack Javascript developer with a focus on the MERN stack. I
        love all things React and my core competencies are in front end
        development. I design my own wireframes and UI in Sketch. I have
        experience developing in the React Native framework for the mobile as
        well.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        I love binging on problems from CodeWars, HackerRank or Project Euler.
        In my free time, I look for pieces to learn and play on the piano from
        youtube, hdpiano or flowkey. I am a Beatlemaniac and Ramin Djawadi's
        music is my bible for music theory.
