    I'm a full stack Javascript developer with a focus on the MERN stack. I love all things React and my core competencies are in front end development. I design my own wireframes and UI in Sketch. I have experience developing in the React Native framework for the mobile as well.

    I love binging on problems from CodeWars, HackerRank or Project Euler. In my free time, I look for pieces to learn and play on the piano from youtube, hdpiano or flowkey. I am a Beatlemaniac and Ramin Djawadi's music is my bible for music theory.
